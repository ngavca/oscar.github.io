     <h2>About:</h2>
   <p>
    "Oscar the neanderthal" is an endangered species whose main habitat is his cave where he  is reaching degeneracy levels unseen by anyone.
    Since getting him to socialize is an impossible  task, this species is doomed to die out if help will not be provided. 
    Time to times, this rare species  gets out of his cave in order to obtain food or see his only two friends that are trying their best to save him. However, since this species lives on Mars, travelling to Wien Miette deems to be
    a strenuous  task for him which is why he spends most of his time alone in his cave. Nobody knows exactly what  he does in his cave as it remains a mystery till this day. 
    Research has shown that his favourite hobbies are but not limited to (since a lot is yet to be discovered):
     <ul>
        <li>Playing strategy games from the previous century that nobody plays</li>
        <li>Staring awkwardly at his interlocutor</li>
        <li>Saying "Anyways" after he realizes that he fucked up the joke(that happens often).</li>
        <li> Not responding to anyone's texts for days and sometimes even up to a week</li>
        <li>This hobby is not yet fully proved, but it's rumored that if it is irritated and scared when random  people approach it, it implements the <a class="cool" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4e8ka0oZHM">"Full-protection mode"</a>.</li>
    </ul>
     <p>Beware if you are a girl and would like to communicate with him as not enough research has been conducted in this area, hence, his actions and behaviour around opposite sex is unknown and thus we strongly encourage you to not act irrationally. If you wish to proceed anyway, we recommend to consult with the organization beforehand. </p>
   </p>
   <h2>How can you help?</h2>
   <p>So at this point you are wondering how can you help to save this wonderful species. Our organization  has been thinking day and night on how to ensure that this species survives and it came to a conclusion 
     that it is impossible. While we will continue our research, we have decided that since he will never experience a coitus on his own, we might as well gift him a night at the "Red Light District"(Oscar, we know that you chose Netherlands for this exact reason, no need to be asamed:)) . </p></p>Our organization will 
       greatly appreciate any <a class="cool" href="donate.htm">donations</a> that would go to this noble cause of ensuring his happiness. If you have any other considerations  and ideas of how to help him, please reach out to me with  any propositions. Also, if you would like to  contribute to this website, you are always welcome!
